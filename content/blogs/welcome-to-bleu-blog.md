Welcome to the new BLEU community blog!

We've rebuilt our platform from the ground up with a focus on **simplicity**, **openness**, and **community participation**.

## What's New?

### 100% Open Source

Everything is transparent. The entire website lives in a GitHub repository that anyone can fork, modify, and contribute to.

### Submit via Pull Request

Want to share your knowledge? No complicated CMS, no accounts needed. Just:

1. Fork the repo
2. Write your Markdown post
3. Open a PR
4. Get community feedback
5. Merge = Published!

This means your contribution history is part of Git, forever.

### Comments via GitHub Discussions

All comments are powered by [giscus](https://giscus.app), which uses GitHub Discussions. If you have a GitHub account, you can comment directly!

### Discord Integration

We display live community stats from our Discord server. Join us to connect with other developers!

## Tech Stack

Our new blog is built with:

- **[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)** - A simple, powerful static site generator
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** - Utility-first CSS
- **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)** - Free hosting
- **[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)** - Automated builds

The entire site is **static HTML**—no database, no server, just blazing fast pages.

## Get Involved

We'd love for you to be part of this community:

- **Write a blog post** - Share your knowledge
- **Report issues** - Help us improve
- **Suggest features** - Tell us what you want
- **Star the repo** - Show your support

Check out our [Contributing Guide](/contributing/) to get started!

## What's Next?

This is just the beginning. We have plans for:

- Tag-based filtering
- Search functionality
- RSS feed
- Dark mode
- And more...

All of these can be built by the community. PRs welcome!
