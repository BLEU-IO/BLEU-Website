Writing has always been a way of transferring knowledge, sharing experiences, and documenting thoughts. And in my opinion, blog posts and articles are a great medium to do that. In a few sentences, so it's not a book nor a social-media post, You can share a lot with people on the internet.

That's why I completely miss the point of writing a blog post with AI. You have to own your writings, your style. They are **Your** ideas. You have to write them.

But with code? I don't care if you submit a PR that claude wrote. You own the problem and You own the solution, as far it is good, I'd happily merge *your* code. It's Yours not the LLM's as long as You submitted it.

But blog posts are one of them things that cannot be replaced with a machine. That's a huge drift-away from the purpose of writing it in the first place.

Please, make the world a better slop-free place.
